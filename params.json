{"name":"Peer Eyes","body":"### Welcome to Peer Eyes\r\nPeer Eyes is a project born out of a simple graduate computer networking course. The idea was simple. Create a program which allows users to see the screens of other users on the local network. The plan for simple usage goes a little something like this. \r\n\r\nSay you have 5 members on your team working together on a project. Each person runs the Peer Eyes application and it automatically finds neighbors on the network. If you're wondering what team member 3 is working on you can make a few clicks and see exactly what is going on. ***Crossing my fingers***, since everyone can see what each other member is doing it will help keep people focused on the task at hand in order to promote productivity.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n2012, Jared Dickson (@kraihn)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Peer Eyes? Well, it's not done yet, so don't expect perfection. But I'll try my hardest to get this going towards being a consistently usable application! Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/kraihn/peer-eyes/issues) on the project and/or get involved :)","tagline":"Cooperation Over Supervision","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
