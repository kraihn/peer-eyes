        <h3>Welcome to Peer Eyes</h3>

<p>Peer Eyes is a project born out of a simple graduate computer networking course. The idea was simple. Create a program which allows users to see the screens of other users on the local network. The plan for simple usage goes a little something like this. </p>

<p>Say you have 5 members on your team working together on a project. Each person runs the Peer Eyes application and it automatically finds neighbors on the network. If you're wondering what team member 3 is working on you can make a few clicks and see exactly what is going on. <strong><em>Crossing my fingers</em></strong>, since everyone can see what each other member is doing it will help keep people focused on the task at hand in order to promote productivity.</p>

<p>Having trouble with Peer Eyes? Well, it's not done yet, so don't expect perfection. But I'll try my hardest to get this going towards being a consistently usable application! Feel free to create an <a href="https://github.com/kraihn/peer-eyes/issues">issue</a> on the project and/or get involved :)</p>
